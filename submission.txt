Scraped Website: https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/threat-encyclopedia/malware

I scraped information about each malware entry that is available online in Trend Micro's Threat Encyclopedia (I could find about 500 entries as of 4/18/2021). 
It includes basic information that researchers have found for various malware samples.

The fields I collected describe the name of the malware, the platform/OS it runs on,  the infection channel, the payload, 
whether the malware is resident in memory, the file type/extension, the file size (in bytes), the date the malware sample was first received, and 
the date of pattern release (when the signature was first included in the scan engine as an update/new release).
